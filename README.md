# CCOM.net

Really simple example of using MIMOSA CCOM v4.1 in C#/.Net. Uses XML Serialization 
framework with mostly auto-generated classes. Some modifications were required to 
resolve issue of 'unsupported' elements occurring in the generated classes initially, 
which were only detected at runtime.

Works with .Net Core v6.
